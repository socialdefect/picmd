picmd
=====

picmd is a simple wrapper script that can save a lot of keystrokes when managing a RaspberryPi device using a SSH connection. It includes most basic features like: open a remote shell, execute remote commands, start/stop/enable/disable system services, halt and reboot the system, manage software and updates, mount remote folders using sshfs and some more stuff. It has been written for Raspbian but most functions will work on most distributions and all others can be easily ported.
